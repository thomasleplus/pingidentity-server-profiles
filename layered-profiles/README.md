## Layered Profiles

In this Server Profile example, PingFederate configuration is layered using multiple GitHub
repo locations to build the overall product configuration.

To run this example, clone the repository, navigate to this directory and run

```
    docker-compose up -d
```

For additional information on this example, please review [Creating Layered Profiles](https://pingidentity-devops.gitbook.io/devops/server-profiles/layering_server_profiles) walkthough.
